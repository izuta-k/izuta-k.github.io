I think that in order to truly understand who someone really is you should take a look at how this person spends their time. What do they want to do in the short time frames they have into the future. In order to make myself understandable for someone who doesn't know me I will try to explain how I spend my time and what I want to achieve in this page.

# 2025 Goals
- Setting up a homelab server for my personal use
- Read the introductory pages of contemporary political science books in my radar. [I should put the list in a post somewhere here]
- Establish fundamental Data Science skills. 
- Write 2 academic essays
- A c1 english certificate from IELTS or TOEFL (whichever is cheaper and more acceptable for my purposes)
- Somewhat of a recovered GPA that will not get me rejected from masters scholarships.

#### izuta-k.github.io
This blog. I just wanted a blogger to write more consistently and put it out there but in the end I wanted a solution where I could migrate everything easily in case I wanted to. I ended up setting up a static github pages blog using jekyll and some basic HTML&CSS knowledge. I also integrated GIT to my workflow as well. Its a fun thing.

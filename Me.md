#### izuta-k.github.io
This blog. I just wanted a blogger to write more consistently and put it out there but in the end I wanted a solution where I could migrate everything easily in case I wanted to. I ended up setting up a static github pages blog using jekyll and some basic HTML&CSS knowledge. I also integrated GIT to my workflow as well. Its a fun thing.

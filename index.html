    <h3>About this Blog</h3>

      <p>I opened this blog in an attempt to finalize my everlong search for a reliable way to publish what I write. I definitely do not have the energy or the necessary skills to maintain a proper website but I write almost all of the code bits that jekyll compiles for this site myself. This blog is a half portfolio half personal blog kinda place. I have no idea what to do with this blog but my main goal here is that in case I ever need to pull my writings to someplace else I will be able to easily do it.</p>

    <h3>What I Write About</h3>
    <p> I try to write more about random rantings that I have about daily casual experiences. I have a fascination about the human ability to internalize big changes that happen over a period of time. I grew up in one of the most dynamic city in the world and saw almost complete overhauls of districts or places in a couple of years. This makes me even more fascinated by the fact that things can be built from scratch in a couple of years rather than just being sad because my childhood scenery will never exist in this world again.

    <h3> Bri√®vement </h3>

      <p> I have always been enthusiastic about collecting empty notebooks and agendas (especially the pretty ones) to write. I have collected lots of pretty notebooks but I have never been able to actually start writing on them because using them meant "dirtying" them. In a sense this space will be a sterile place that cannot be defiled by idle scribbles and writing.</p>

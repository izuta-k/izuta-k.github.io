    <h3> Bri√®vement </h3>

      <p> I have always been enthusiastic about collecting empty notebooks and agendas (especially the pretty ones) to write. I have collected lots of pretty notebooks but I have never been able to actually start writing on them because using them meant "defiling" them. In a sense this space will be a sterile place that cannot be defiled by idle scribbles and writing.</p>

    <h3> My Latest Endeavors </h3>
    <p> I fixed my 3d printer without breaking any parts. I was enthusiastic about fixing it and using the printer to print a sturdy case for a homelab server. I realised after fixing the printer that I lack the necessary CAD skills to design a custom motherboard case for a 16 year old laptop. It is doable but needs a lot of time.

    Trying out new recipes. When you are diabetic its hard to enjoy any meal until you cannot eat anymore. Before I was diagnosed it was my comfort move to eat until I require a walk to digest everything. But now I just try to make 1 piece of extremely delicious wrap and enjoy the process of preparing it instead of simply enjoying the act of eating.

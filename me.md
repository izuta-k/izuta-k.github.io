I am a senior bachelor's student focusing on regional development, urban transformation, and political economy. My work frequently combines spatial data analysis with socio-political frameworks to understand how urban infrastructure shapes structural and electoral realities. 

Following my Francophone bachelor's degree at Marmara University, my current trajectory is focused on graduate research in Canada, applying data-driven methodologies to urban studies.

## Academic Profile

## Research Interests
My current research focuses on the **instrumentalization of urban projects for political and social reconfiguration**. I am particularly interested in:
* **Electoral Geography:** How urban transformation and infrastructure projects influence spatial voting patterns.
* **Political Economy:** The intersection of urban projects, clientelism, and social engineering.
* **Crisis Analysis:** Tracking the structural causes of financial crises and their impact on the development of the urban bourgeoisie.

## Projects

**Istanbul Transport Analyzer** An analytical tool built in Jupyter Notebooks that processes open data from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB). It provides district-level, comparative visualizations of public transit usage over specified timeframes to track mobility patterns.

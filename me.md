I am a senior bachelor's student focusing on regional development, urban transformation, and political economy. My work frequently combines spatial data analysis with socio-political frameworks to understand how urban infrastructure shapes structural and electoral realities. 

Following my Francophone bachelor's degree at Marmara University, my current trajectory is focused on graduate research in Canada, applying data-driven methodologies to urban studies.
